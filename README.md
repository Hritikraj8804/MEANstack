# MEAN Stack Notes & Assignments

This repository contains my notes and assignments related to the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). These resources are compiled from various sources, including tutorials, documentation, and hands-on coding exercises, and are intended to provide a structured approach to learning the MEAN stack.


## Overview

The MEAN stack is a powerful JavaScript-based technology stack for building modern web applications. It consists of the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js to build APIs and handle HTTP requests.
- **Angular**: A front-end framework for building dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs).
- **Node.js**: A server-side JavaScript runtime for building scalable applications.

This repository includes notes, code snippets, and assignments that demonstrate my understanding of these technologies.

## Technologies Covered

- **MongoDB**: Database setup, CRUD operations, and data modeling.
- **Express.js**: Building RESTful APIs, middleware, routing.
- **Angular**: Component-based architecture, services, directives, and data binding.
- **Node.js**: Server-side scripting, asynchronous programming, event handling.
